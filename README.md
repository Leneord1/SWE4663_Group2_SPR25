username: admin <br />
password: 1234 <br />
**EMPLOYEE ACCOUNT**<br />

Access for the frontend files:  graphingTool/src/main/resources/org/example/graphingtool <br />
**HOW TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE** <br />
Download the graphingTool directory, parse through the file to get to the main.java file in the backend files.  This is the code that launches the software.  The login that allows access to everything is the admin account.  The Employee class login has the same level of access due to complications in creating the databases.  This will be explained within the Presentation
